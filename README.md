# 📝 Simple To-Do List App (PyQt6)

## 🚀 What is this?
A clean, minimalistic **To-Do List app** built with **PyQt6**. It’s got a custom **title bar**, a smooth dark theme, and lets you add and remove tasks with style. Tasks are bold, the scrollbar is sleek, and the whole thing just looks 🔥.

##  Why is this?
well microsofts todo list app sucks, i mean a simple todo list app shouldnt need 500mb to run and all the shit that happenes with their shitty todo list app, hence i decided to take matters in my own hands 


## 🎯 Features
✅ **Add tasks** easily with a text box.  
✅ **Check off tasks** (checkbox style).  
✅ **Delete completed tasks** with a click.  
✅ **Custom title bar** with draggable window & working minimize/maximize/close buttons.  
✅ **Gradient dark mode** for that aesthetic look.  
✅ **Minimalist scrollbars** so they don’t mess up the UI.  
✅ **Save tasks** so they persist after closing

## 📦 How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```sh
   pip install PyQt6
   ```
2. **Run the app:**  
   ```sh
   python Main.py
   ```
   
## 🎁 Packaging it into an EXE
Want to make it a standalone app? Run:
```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name ToDoApp Main.py
```

This creates an `.exe` inside `dist/`
(btw i also added an exe build in the root)
## 🎯 Future Improvements (Maybe?)  
- Add some smooth **animations** (if they stop breaking stuff).  
- Make a **mobile version** ( currently what i am working on, helps me learn electron).
- https://github.com/deadman22-rgb/ElectronBasedToDoList electron based version's repo

Made with **Python + PyQt6**, and a bit of rage when animations misbehaved.
